    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "ANS:------->\n",
    "A database is a collection of data that is organized in a structured way,\n",
    "allowing it to be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used in\n",
    "a wide range of applications, from simple record-keeping to complex data analysis and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two broad categories\n",
    "of database management systems that differ in their approach to storing and querying data.\n",
    "Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, where data is organized into \n",
    "tables with defined relationships between them. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, \n",
    "use a variety of different data models, including document-oriented, key-value, and graph models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Schema: SQL databases have a predefined schema that specifies the structure of \n",
    "each table and the relationships between them. NoSQL databases are schemaless or have \n",
    "flexible schema, which means that the structure of the data can evolve over time without\n",
    "requiring changes to the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Query language: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying data, which provides a \n",
    "standard syntax for accessing and manipulating data. NoSQL databases typically have their\n",
    "own query languages or APIs that are specific to the data model used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Scalability: SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, meaning that they can handle \n",
    "larger amounts of data by increasing the computing resources of a single server.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed to be horizontally scalable, meaning that they can handle\n",
    "larger amounts of data by adding more servers to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.ACID compliance: SQL databases are designed to be ACID-compliant, which means that\n",
    "they provide strong guarantees for data consistency, integrity, and durability. \n",
    "NoSQL databases may or may not be ACID-compliant, depending on the specific implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require a predefined schema,\n",
    "complex queries, and strong data consistency guarantees, while NoSQL databases are better for\n",
    "applications that require flexible schema, high scalability, and fast data access. \n",
    "However, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements\n",
    "of the application and the tradeoffs between the different features and benefits of each type of database.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of DDL commands and their use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create new database objects,\n",
    "such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. For example, the following\n",
    "command creates a new table called \"customers\" with columns for \"id\", \"name\", and \"email\":\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "DROP: The DROP command is used to remove database objects, such as tables, views, indexes,\n",
    "and constraints. For example, the following command drops the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object,\n",
    "such as adding or removing columns from a table, or modifying the definition of a constraint.\n",
    "For example, the following command adds a new column called \"address\" to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN address VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "    \n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all data from a table, but does not remove \n",
    "the table itself. This is useful when you want to clear the data from a table without deleting\n",
    "the table structure. For example, the following command removes all data from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are important DDL commands used to create, modify, \n",
    "and delete database objects. These commands are used to define the structure of a database and manage \n",
    "its contents, and are essential for maintaining the integrity and performance of a database.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "ANS:---->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a set of SQL\n",
    "commands used to manipulate data in a database. DML commands are used to add, \n",
    "modify, and delete data in database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of DML commands and their use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT: The INSERT command is used to add new data to a table.\n",
    "For example, the following command adds a new row to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO customers (id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'John Smith', 'john@example.com');\n",
    "\n",
    "This command adds a new customer to the \"customers\" table with an id of 1, a name of 'John Smith', \n",
    "and an email of 'john@example.com'.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE: The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in a table. \n",
    "For example, the following command updates the email address of the customer \n",
    "with an id of 1 in the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE customers SET email = 'jsmith@example.com' WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "This command changes the email address of the customer with an id of 1 from 'john@example.com' to \n",
    "'jsmith@example.com'.\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE: The DELETE command is used to remove data from a table. For example, \n",
    "the following command removes the customer with an id of 1 from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "This command removes the customer with an id of 1 from the \"customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are important DML commands used to add, modify,\n",
    "and remove data in database tables. These commands are essential for maintaining the accuracy \n",
    "and consistency of data in a database, and are commonly used in application development, data analysis,\n",
    "and reporting.\n",

    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "ANS:---->\n",
    "DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to retrieve data from a database.\n",
    "DQL commands are used to select and filter data from database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a DQL command and its use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: The SELECT command is used to retrieve data from a table based on specified criteria. \n",
    "For example, the following command retrieves all data from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "    \n",
    "SELECT * FROM customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "This command retrieves all data from the \"customers\" table, which includes all rows and columns in the table.\n",
    "Here is an example of a more complex SELECT statement that retrieves specific data from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT name, email FROM customers WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "This command retrieves the \"name\" and \"email\" columns for the customer\n",
    "with an id of 1 in the \"customers\" table. The WHERE clause is used to filter the results\n",
    "based on the specified condition, which in this case is \"id = 1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT command can also be used to aggregate data and perform calculations on it. \n",
    "For example, the following command calculates the average price of all products in the \"products\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT AVG(price) FROM products;\n",
    "\n",
    "This command retrieves the average price of all products in the \"products\" table.\n",
    "In summary, SELECT is an important DQL command used to retrieve data from a database \n",
    "based on specified criteria. This command is essential for analyzing and reporting on\n",
    "data in a database, and is commonly used in application development and data analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "ANS:----->\n",
    "In a relational database, a primary key is a column or set of columns in a table \n",
    "that uniquely identifies each row in that table. A primary key is used to enforce data\n",
    "integrity and ensure that there are no duplicate rows in a table. A foreign key, on the \n",
    "other hand, is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of \n",
    "another table. A foreign key is used to create relationships between tables in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how primary keys and foreign keys work in a database:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have two tables: \"orders\" and \"customers\". The \"orders\" table contains \n",
    "information about each customer order, such as the order id, customer id, order date, \n",
    "and order total. The \"customers\" table contains information about each customer, such as the \n",
    "customer id, name, address, and email.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a relationship between the two tables, we would use the customer \n",
    "id column in the \"orders\" table as a foreign key that refers to the primary key of \n",
    "the \"customers\" table. This means that for each row in the \"orders\" table, there is a \n",
    "corresponding row in the \"customers\" table with the same customer id value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer id column in the \"customers\" table is the primary key, since it uniquely\n",
    "identifies each customer in the table. The customer id column in the \"orders\" table is \n",
    "the foreign key, since it refers to the primary key of the \"customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using primary keys and foreign keys, we can create relationships between tables and ensure \n",
    "that data is consistent and accurate across the database. This is important for maintaining data \n",
    "integrity and avoiding data redundancy.\n",

    "ANS:----->\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to MySQL from Python, we need to use a Python MySQL library such \n",

    "arguments to this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use the mydb.cursor() method to create a cursor object. A cursor is an object\n",

    "\n",
    "We then use the mycursor.execute() method to execute a SQL query. In this case,\n",
